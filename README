= Viennese Meldezettel Form Lookup Helper =

This set of scripts is intended to help find records in the Vienna Meldezettel (männliche 
und weibliche Personen), 1850-1928.

You can use the script here:

According to the microfilm listing, the Meldezettel are POPULATION REGISTERS for individual
residents of the city of Vienna, Austria.  The cards include name, birth date and place, 
marital status, old and new places of residence, dates of arrival and departure. Occasionally 
the name of spouse and children are listed. Most records range from 1890 to 1925. The 
beginning name on each microfilm is shown. The same name may also appear on the preceeding 
microfilm. All male (männliche) names are filed first, followed by all female (weibliche) 
names in a separate sequence.

The form will return a list of suggested FHL form numbers you can try and order from any 
Family History Library branch or from the Salt Lake HQ.

PLEASE NOTE: In my experience, the sorting on the FHL films is rather inconsistent, and I'm 
sure the algorithm used by this web page is imperfect as well. As such, your mileage may vary. 
If you're lucky, the name you're searching for will be in the first record suggested, but that
only happens maybe half the time. Usually the record will be on ONE of the films suggested but
even that is not always the case.
